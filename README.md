#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of applications.
Companies must be able to streamline processes and gain a competitive edge.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
1990 to 1999: Prominence of the Internet and the growth of browser usage running on the use of HTML.
2000 to 2015: Lightweight methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP), which attempted to simplify many areas of software engineering, including requirements gathering and reliability testing for the growing, vast number of small software systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Phase; it states the resources needed, the timeline of the project, and the delegation of tasks to each team member.
Design Phase; Here, designers develop solutions that meet the requirements.
Implementation Phase; Once the design is finalized and approved, it's time to implement it. Design hands off their specifications to developers to build.
Testing Phase; Here we test for all use cases to ensure a good user experience.
Deployment of the system; Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.
Maintenance Phase; it involves fixing any issues that arise after the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while agile methodology is iterative and incremental 
Agile is flexible meaning changes can be made at any point of development while waterfall is well defined and its requirements are very specific.
Example:
A startup developing a new mobile app might use Agile to quickly iterate on features based on user feedback, enabling rapid adjustments and improvements based on real-world usage and evolving market needs.
Engineers building a road would use the waterfall model due to its well-defined requirements as opposed to agile methodology.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Builds and designs computer programs that power mobile devices, desktop computers, and even cars.
Quality Assurance Engineer - They oversee every phase of design, development, testing, and delivery to verify if the product meets the quality standards and requirements.
Project manager - ensure that projects meet deadlines, stay within budget, and adhere to quality standards. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Code Management: IDEs often include built-in support for managing project files and dependencies. They can automatically handle tasks like compiling code and managing libraries, which simplifies the development workflow.
Example - Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.
Collaboration: VCSs allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously by managing changes and merging code from different contributors. This is crucial for team-based development.
Example - Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Broken SDLC Processes - this is solved by proper planning in the requirement phase and documentation at every point.
Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges - we solve this by using security testing tools and platforms for enhanced security and also Define coding standards to write scalable code.
Developer Burnout - we should invest in a culture of learning & reward (off time, recognition, and performance-based increments).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - tests individual components it is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
Integration - tests group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules.
System testing - it tests the entire system, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
Acceptance testing -  involves testing the systemâ€™s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs and make it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Clarity: It specifies the topic (photosynthesis) and what aspect to cover (benefits to plants and the environment).
Specificity: It limits the scope by asking for a brief explanation, avoiding overly broad or unfocused responses.
Conciseness: By narrowing down the request to a specific process and its impacts, it directs the response towards precise information.
